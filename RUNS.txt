Disk times:
     Av. Seek Time = 3 - 15 ms
     Av. Rotational Latency = 5.5 ms
     Av. Data Transfer Rate = varies -> 480 Mbps = .48 Mbpms
     Therefore, Av. Disk Service Time ~ 9 - 21 ms for a MB

CPU times
    Estimated as being quicker than disk times since reading and writing
    from disks is very slow.

Inter-Arrival time
    Estimated as being fairly consistent with CPU and DISK times as
    events and processes would be created fairly often as a system runs.

What I have learned:
     As long as the queue for a subsystem is occupied, the subsystem will have
     a high utilization. However, if the subsystem's queue fills faster than
     it can process a job, the max-response time and average response
     will increase to longer and longer times as the simulation runs. Ideally,
     all subsystems would have relatively high utilizations with small queues.
     Therefore the response time for all subsystems would be low and processes
     would be processed as quickly and efficiently as possible.
